// Game will need to be written in a way that it can be played again without refreshing the page*** 

// Display start button
    // when hit, show question, answers, and timer (30 seconds)

// Display question, answer choices, and timer
    // Timer Ticks at 1 second intervals, put reset so interval won't compound
    // if it hits 0, stop at 0, say "Time's Up", display correct answer
    // if wrong, say "Wrong" and show right answer
    // if right, say "Correct"
    // Right, wrong, or timeout, pause the clock and wait 5~ seconds. Then move to next question (WITHOUT user input)

// Game Ends
    // Display number of correct and incorrect answers
    // Display timeouts (if there are none, don't. Idk how this will work out, but good luck)
    // ***Play again button that DOES NOT refresh the page, just starts the came over***
